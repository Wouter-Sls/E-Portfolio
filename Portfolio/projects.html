                </div>
                <p>This project was made in my first year when I was a student in KDG Antwerp. It is a webshop for sneakers. You can view all sneakers and filter on color and brand. You can also personalize your own sneaker. This was an assignement for User Interfaces class in my first year at KDG Antwerp. During this project I learned how to make a website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

                    <h3>Pastries & bakeries</h3>
                </div>
                <p>This is a web application to view and manage the available pastries in different bakeries. It is written in C# and it is based on a Model View Controller (MVC). The project was made for a .NET course in my second year at KDG Antwerp. During this project I learned to create a web application using MVC.</p>

                    <h3>Warehouse</h3>
                </div>
                <p>This was a group project, for a Requirement Analysis course at Thomas More Geel, to improve the warehouse management for a client. We made a use case diagram with all functionalities. For every use case we also made wireframes to visualize that functionality. This task was a preparation to code the web application in PHP.</p>
